The spatial resolution that can be achieved with any light-based microscopy is however limited to about 200nm in the imaging plane and >500nm along the optical axis. It has been a motivation and a challenge to bypass this limit in spatial resolution, and to extend the range of fluorescence microscopy reaching a near-molecular resolution. A selection of techniques that successfully demonstrated sub-diffraction resolution fluorescence imaging and which today are used for imaging of small cellular structures is reviewed.},

	abstract = {Author summary To understand the cell biology captured by microscopy images, researchers use features, or measurements of relevant properties of cells, such as the shape or size of cells, or the intensity of fluorescent markers. Features are the starting point of most image analysis pipelines, so their quality in representing cells is fundamental to the success of an analysis. Classically, researchers have relied on features manually defined by imaging experts. In contrast, deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) automatically learn features, which can outperform manually-defined features at image analysis tasks. However, most CNN methods require large manually-annotated training datasets to learn useful features, limiting their practical application. Here, we developed a new CNN method that learns high-quality features for single cells in microscopy images, without the need for any labeled training data. We show that our features surpass other comparable features in identifying protein localization from images, and that our method can generalize to diverse datasets. By exploiting our method, researchers will be able to automatically obtain high-quality features customized to their own image datasets, facilitating many downstream analyses, as we highlight by demonstrating many possible use cases of our features in this study.},
