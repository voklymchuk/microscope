\begin{abstract}
Smartphones are increasingly being used to store personal information as well as to access sensitive data from the Internet and the cloud. Establishment of the identity of a user requesting information from smartphones is a prerequisite for  secure systems in such scenarios. In the past, keystroke-based user identifiation has been successfully deployed on production-level mobile devices to mitigate the risks associated with naive username/password based authentication. However, these approaches have two major limitations: they are not applicable to services where authentication occurs outside the domain of the mobile
device such as web-based services; and they often overly tax the limited computational capabilities of mobile devices.

In this paper, we propose a protocol for keystroke dynamics analysis which allows web-based applications to make use of remote attestation and delegated keystroke analysis. The end result is an efficient keystroke-based user identification mechanism that strengthens traditional password protected services
while mitigating the risks of user profiling by collaborating malicious web
services. We present a prototype implementation of our protocol using
the popular Android operating system for smartphones.

\section{Introduction} 
This is going to be a normal paragraph in our introduction. 


\subsection{Some Background} 
Some more stuff~\cite{Heilemann2012} and here~\cite{tucker1964extension} and here~\cite{10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007348}. 

\subsubsection{Drilled Down}\label{sec:drilled-down}
More information here. 

Wide field microscope is the oldes type. 

1. Does it use transmitted light or fluorescence?

Transmitted light is
good for measuring cell behaviour, non perturbing, can be done with long timelapse images, simple, uncomlecated technique.

No special preparation is needed for specimen, 
No  genetic encoding is needed
Less damaging than flourescence excitation.
Good for long term observation of cells.

Dark field (transmitted light) microscopy of single microtubules in vitro can be very effective.
 
Fluorescence
Good for measuring molecular behaviour, if you want to measure specific organell you need a molecular marker, and need to go with flourescence.

Are you looking at a thick or thin specimen? Different techniques are appropriate based on depth.

Are you looking at a living or a fixed sample? Rate of acquisition and cellular damage.

Epi-fluorescence (Wide-Field) Imaging - is the easiest and simplest type of fluorescence 
Pros:
Low cost (no lasers)
Easy to use.
Cons:
Lower signal to background (out of focus fluorescence).
More damaging to live cells

They used fixed cells

Deconvolution Microscopy - computational technique of remooving out-off-focus light blure computationally. You get more information or more clarity out of your epi-fluorescent image.
Processes a Z stack of images. Does computational correction. Requires an epi-fluorescence microscope, motorized z-axis spepper for taking Z-sections, and software to sharpen it computationally.

After deconvolution you see a much sharper and crisper image. 

Other class of getting multiple optical sections is using optics and not a computer. 

Optical sectioning is done with lasers. 

Laser-based Sectioning Microscopy
Depends on the depth of your spesimen.

- Objects near the coverslip surface:
Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF)
Does not allow you to penetrate very far , good within 200 nm from the coverslip surface

- If you have a thicker sample ( <100 um thick) like a cell or a section of a tissue, you will need a pinhole microscopy (point or line scanning or spinning disk).

- if you had an even thicker spesimen (>100 um thick (e.g.tissue)):
two photon microscopy or physical sectioning technique - array tomography

Spinning Disc vs Point Scanning Microscopy 

Spinning disc confocal microscopy (<30 um microns ) images are acquired by a camera. 
1. Good for live cell imaging and fast acquisition. 
Smalled cellular damage.

Point Scanninf Confocal Microscopy (<100 um)
1. Good for fixed specimens.
Slower than spinning disc.
More damaging to live tissue..
2. Good for combinging photobleaching and imaging

Light Sheet Microscopy Technique or sectioning. 
It only illuminates specimen in one focal plane, less photodamage, 
Godd for fast acquisition of complex structures like embryo genesis.


2 Photon microscopy is more suitable for thick tissue samples. 

Physical sectioning of a brain is another thechnique - still-Array Tomography.

\section{Super-Resolution Microscopy}\label{sec:superres}

Conventional - ~200-250 nm at best
Structural Illumination - ~100 nm Live Imaging
STORM/PALM and STED - ~40 nm Most powerfull for fixed samples

For comparison:
Cryo-EM - ~2-4 nm Frozen samples, unstained, complex. 

Measuring cellular or biochemical activities with light.



\section{Tables, figures and subfiles}\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Tables and Figures}

To insert a figure, you can use the TeXnicecenter menus. 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{att-models-base.pdf}
	\caption{My First Figure}
	\label{fig:att-models-base}

	}
	
	\foreach \i in {1, ..., 3}{
		\node [hcirc] (h\i) at (\i*2,3) {$h^\i$};
	}
	
	\foreach \i in {1, ..., 3}{
		\node [xcirc] (x\i) at (\i*2,0) {$x_\i$};
	}
	
	\foreach \i in {1, ..., 3}{
		\foreach \v in {1, ..., 3}{
			\path (h\i) edge [draw] (x\v);
		}
	}
	\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Cross-references} 
Some text here that wants to refer to Table~\ref{tab:MyFirstTable}. You can also refer to the Figure~\ref{fig:att-models-base}. When you want to refer to a previous section, you can use the \Verb|\ref| command again. Section~\ref{sec:background} and Section~\ref{sec:drilled-down}. 

\input{subfile} 


\section{Displaying Mathematics}

\LaTeX\ is extremely powerful when it comes to typesetting mathematics. It's one of the core strengths of this system. 

There are two ways of displaying maths. One is \emph{inline} and the other is \emph{display} format -- in which the whole math sits on its own set of lines.


\subsection{Inline Mode}
We are going to insert a mathematics equation inline here using a pair of \$ signs: $E=mc^2$   . As you can see, the display (such as line spacing) does not get messed up by the mathematics as it does with word processing softwares. 

\subsection{Display Mode}
We can also display equations in their own set of lines. To do this, we can use the equation environment. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:emc}
E=mc^2
\end{equation}

As you can see, \LaTeX\ inserts the equation number automatically. We can refer to it using the \Verb|\ref| command just as we referred to sections, figures and tables. (E.g. Equation~\ref{eq:emc}.) To get rid of the equation number, simply use the \emph{star variant} of the equation environment. (For this, you need the \texttt{amsmath} package.)

\begin{equation*}
E=mc^2
\end{equation*}

Alternatively, we can use the shorthand keys \Verb|\[| and \Verb|\]|
\[
E=mc^2
\]


\section{Mathematical Features}
\LaTeX\ has many builtin features and you can get many more easily. Here, we'll see some of these features: 

Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division: 

\[
x+2 - 25 \times 35 \div 98 
\]

Superscripts and subscripts: 

\[ x^2  \]
\[ x_{(i)} \]


Summation, union, intersection, big-union, integral: 

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n}{i^2} \]
\[ x \cup y \cap z \]
\[ \bigcup_{i=1}^{n}{x_i} \]
\[ \int_0^n{x^2} \]

Fractions, brackets, square root: 

\[ \frac{x}{y} \]
\[ \frac{\sum_i{x^2}}{\int_0^n{x^2}} \]
\[ \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{36}} {x^5}} \]

\[ 2 \times \left( \frac{34}{\frac{124}{356}}    \right)  \]

Greek letters: 

\[
\alpha + \beta + \gamma^* + \Sigma + \Theta + 2_\epsilon 
\]

Matrices and vectors. For this, you need to include the \texttt{amsmath} package and then use the \texttt{bmatrix} or \texttt{pmatrix} environment: 

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{a}{44} & b \\ 
c & \sqrt{d} 	
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Accents: 

\[ \hat{x} \]
\[ \hat{\imath} \] 
\[ \dot{x} \]

See the \texttt{Math} menu in the IDE for other operations. You can refer to ``Short Math Guide for \LaTeX'' for a lot more examples. 

\section{Using Symbols}
You might come across situations where you need to find new symbols. For this, you can refer to the ``The Comprehensive \LaTeX Symbols List''.  

\[ x \rightleftharpoons  y \]



(Optional) Since this is a long command, we might want to create a shortcut using the \verb|\newcommand| command in the preamble. This also allows us to later change the symbol without having to change the equations. 

\[ x \flow y \]

\section{Algorithms}

\begin{algorithm}
	\begin{algorithmic}[2]
		\REQUIRE{Randomly populated array}
		\ENSURE{Sorted array}
		\IF{$i\leq0$}

		\ENDIF
		\RETURN i
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{My First Simple Algorithm}
	\label{algo:first}
\end{algorithm}

And of course, we can refer to the algorithm using \verb|\ref|: See Algorithm~\ref{algo:first} but the good thing is we can also refer to a specific line e.g. Line~\ref{line:impline} or Line~\ref{line:mostimp}.


\section{Code listings}

\lstset{language=c++, float=H}
\lstset{caption=Some C++ Code}

for(i = 0; i < 10; i++){
// increment the pointer
*p++ = i;
}
\end{lstlisting}

%\end{adjustbox}


And we can refer to Listing~\ref{lst:lowertri} in text.

%\end{table}

\medskip
Using and managing bibliographies in \LaTeX\ is very easy. 
These are the steps required to use them: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a main document file 
	\item Collect bibliography entries in a \Verb|.bib| file. For this: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Get the bibliography from Google Scholar/ACM or where ever or 
		\item Write the entry yourself. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Add a \verb|\bibliographystyle| and a \Verb|\bibliography| command to your document. 
	\item \emph{Cite} the references where you need using the key. 
	\item Build the file a couple of times to get the citations in the main document. 
\end{enumerate}




\section{Bibliography citations}
We are going to use this section to put some text in our document and at some points, we are going to inset a reference table~\ref{tab:MyFirstTable1}. This, for example, is going to turn into a reference~\cite{lecun2015deep}. This ~\cite{webster1984specific} is yet another reference. And so on.~\cite{nauman2010apex}

This is going to be a new paragraph.
